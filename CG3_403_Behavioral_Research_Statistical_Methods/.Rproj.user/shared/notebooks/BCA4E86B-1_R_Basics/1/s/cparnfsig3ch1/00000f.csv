## Factors
##############################################################################
# A factor is a vector object used to specify a discrete classification (grouping) of the components of other vectors of the same length.
# can be ordered or unordered

## Example for 'ragged arrays', which can have subclasses of different sizes
# say you have 6 subjects and 3 conditions in your experiment
# this is a list of the condition that each subject took part in
condition=c('faces','scenes','objects','faces','scenes','objects')
# can create a factor for condition
conditionf=factor(condition) #use the factor() function
# print to screen
print(conditionf)

"0","# The function tapply() is used to apply a function, here mean(), to each group  of components of the first argument, here accuracy, defined by the levels of the second component,here conditionf, as if they were separate vector structures. The result is a structure of the same length as the levels attribute of the factor containing the results."
